# quickplotter
Quick little command line tool for plotting x-y data distributions from multiple csv files of the same datatype. 

This was only created for a particular task I was working on, so it isn't particularly robust, but maybe I'll add to it. I found it handy when I had a bunch of csv files of time series data and I wanted to quickly see how they compared. 

Use: 
  $ python quickplotter.py <header for the x data> <header for the y data> -f <path to csv files containing the data>
